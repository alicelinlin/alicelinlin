                  </h2>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">My name’s Alice (Wen Lin), and I reside in Sydney, NSW Australia. I am
Australian Chinese, born in China and migrated to Sydney, Australia, with my
family when I was seven years old; I’m fluent in English and Chinese. I started
my first business in Ecommerce and I now own a Hotel management and Hospitality
consulting company with a business partner based in Sydney, Australia. Our
company mainly offers operations management services, sales and marketing
services, and finance control management services for independent and boutique
hotels, resorts and motels across Australia, south-east Asia and China. 
Education-wise, I dropped out of university doing Bachelor of Law at
UNSW to pursue my dream in entrepreneurship. Since then, I have not completed
any other formal education or training. I have however, been working for the
past 10 years and self-taught most of my skills associated with the operations,
sales and marketing and the development of a business. 
I enjoy art and design, music, spending time with family and friends,
and most of all, traveling. The best part about my job is that it allows me to
use work as an excuse to travel. I have traveled to more than 50 countries for
work or leisure and have stayed in hundreds of different types of hotels.</p>

            <div class="u-border-3 u-border-palette-3-base u-line u-line-horizontal u-line-1"></div>
            <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2">Although I have no IT background and what I do now is not directly
relevant in this field, I
started my first business when I graduated from high school in 2008 in E-commerce.
In order to save money, I actually created my e-commerce website using Magento
back in the day with basic HTML skills completely self-taught using online
tutorials, forums and maybe a textbook or two. 
With
the use of social media platforms, great photography and photoshop skills, good
design, reasonable price, the business did well. It took me around two years
for the business to go off and made more than triple + what a fresh university
graduate would make. That was achievable because of technology, and without it,
my business would never have been launched. 
Likewise,
with my current company, I don’t think it would be where it is today if it
wasn’t because of technology. The use of technology has transformed traditional
Hotel management and marketing concepts. I was able to quickly implement my
online marketing skills with the application of IT systems to traditional hotel
environments. Hotels that we initially took over were mostly traditional hotels;
they were nicely renovated, maintained, and older properties that had huge
potential when it comes to marketing and management. With the integration of
online marketing, guest reservation systems, room management systems, staff
monitoring systems, accounting systems, and better telecommunication systems,
my team and I were able to significantly cut down costs and improve the
efficiency in the hotel operations, hence increasing overall revenue and
profits.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;
Whether in business or social environment, we no longer rely on traditional ways to
operate. With its good and bad, fast-evolving technological enhanc­ements are
inevitable, and it will only progress further and faster in future. 
There is no doubt that we will become more
dependent on
technology in
carrying out our daily activities and technology is and will be the main driver
to any successful businesses.&nbsp; Studying for
a Bachelor of Information Technology, in my opinion, would probably be the next
most important thing I must do to progress further in life. </p>

            <p class="u-text u-text-2">RMIT is well-known for its extensive courses in IT
and computer science. For me, the flexibility and convenience of studying
online is extremely important, and RMIT was one of the only universities on my
list that offered full-time online IT degrees. RMIT is also known to place more
emphasis on student’s practical, hand-on and teamwork skills, which I believe
are very important.&nbsp;</p>

your Expectations?</a>
        </h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">I am looking forward to studying RMIT in the university
environment; although studying online is not like a traditional on-campus
degree, the structure of studying in a school environment gives me a better
direction on where to start with my learnings. 
&nbsp;
By studying information
technology, I hope to develop a better understanding of information technology
and systems, programming languages to create basic and more advanced computer
and mobile software and programs, to gain insight into more information and
data management and artificial intelligence. Ultimately the goal is to apply
these IT skills to solve problems, improve work productivity and our capacity
to perform, and resolve business challenges that come along the way.&nbsp;</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">My ideal job would ultimately be to set up my own tech company. But honestly, ever since starting my business,
I have not really worked for anyone else. Working in an office environment as a
staff is something that I have always wanted to do, especially after touring
Google and Facebook office campus in San Francisco. With all the random free
perks like the meals, snacks, gaming rooms, and tech accessories, not to
mention all the holiday paid leave, sick leave, bonus schemes, job security
etc, who wouldn’t want to work there? My ideal job if I graduate would be to
work in one of these firms in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2">The most significant thing that made me
appealing to this post is the “technical specialist.” I would love to play on technical grounds where several internet
technologies can be used as well as the interactions from dealing with
customers. This position is not just an IT specialist but also gives me a chance to make
connections and build a relationship with these customers and clients that may be
beneficial in the long run.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">What does the results reflect about me and what does this mean to me?&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Mind: Extroverted (92%)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I am an extroverted individual who prefers to get into activities in groups and be energised by social interactions. This means that I’m thrilled about new activities and trying new things, I’m happier and more content when I use my initiative, and I am mostly more satisfied with the time spent with other people than staying alone.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Energy Intuitive (72%)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I am an intuitive individual who is very imaginative, open-minded and curious about the world and everything around it. This means that I prefer novelty over stability and focus on the world's meaning and open to new ideas and possibilities about the future.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Nature: Feeling (64%)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I am a person that follows my heart and emotions; I rely on my feelings more than thinking. I connect and understand others well. I’m caring, compassionate, warm and highly protective of the people around me. Communication with others through emotions is more important than telling them the hard truth. This trait, however, has led me to make decisions based on my heart instead of the most rational thing to do.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Tactics: Judging (69%)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">A judging individual who is decisive, thorough and highly organised when it comes to dealing with future events. I prefer to always have backup plans ahead of time, preferring clarity and closure, often sticking with the plan rather than going with the flow. Once a decision is made and finalised, I will tick it off my checklist and will not re-open the item for re-evaluation. However, this also means that I am a judging individual that usually comes across to others as quite stubborn. If too many surprises arise, it leaves me often frustrated and stressed.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Identity: Assertive (65%)</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I am an assertive individual who is self-assured and refuses to worry too much; I push myself hard when it comes to achieving goals. I worry less about past actions, with a “what is done is done” mentality in mind. However, this confidence can easily turn to overconfidence, meaning that I tend to do what I presume is right much more than others would allow or tolerate.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">What does the results reflect about me and what does this mean to me?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The results reflect that I am a more visual learner than a tactile and auditory learner. I tend to remember by “seeing” the information through images, videos, graphs and other visual items. The results allow me to understand my learning style better, meaning that I will implement more visual strategies to enhance my learning.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Picturing what I have learned in my head and using methods that are primarily visual is more effective when it comes to learning.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As a visual learner, I am nice and clean and like to keep things that I can see organised and visually appealing to me.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">I have more difficulties with spoken directions and may easily be distracted by sounds, and usually attracted to color and spoken language rich in visuals.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Openness: 96 % - the tendency to think in complex or abstract ways. I am an abstract thinker and open to abstract ideas, theories and concepts. I tend to appreciate creative, innovative ideas about the future and I’m filled with curiosity about new ideas and original ways of doing things.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Conscientiousness 60% - The tendency to be persistent and determined in achieving set-out goals. I am somewhat in the middle. I can be spontaneous; however, there is a sense of order when I am working on something. I am usually very determined but can be driven by impulses, there is always a plan usually organised, but I can be distracted and become unorganised along the way.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Extraversion: 96% - The Tendency to be energized being around people vs. being alone. I am a highly extroverted person, giving off a very outgoing, energetic and friendly vibe to those around me. I enjoy stimulations and events with other people in busy and active environments. I am very enthusiastic about life, and quite hyperactive and tend to experience more positive emotions. Scientifically speaking, I have an enhanced response to dopamine in the brain, making me more motivated to pursue rewards and more satisfied when I achieve my goals.</span>
          </p>
          <p>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Overall, what does the results of these tests mean to me?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">These results allow me to understand myself better, pointing out very specific characteristics and traits about me as an individual, even providing insight into the human psyche. It surprises me how accurate some of the points are about me. Allowing me to reflect on myself, strength and flaws somewhat gives me a better direction on what activities and career that is more suitable for me, and re-evaluate decisions I make in the future.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">PERSONALITY TESTS AND TEAMWORK</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">How will these results influence my behaviour in a team? should I take this into account when forming a team?&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The results of these personality tests reveal my ability and integrity when it comes to teamwork. Being the very outgoing, open, and extroverted person that I am, the results accentuate my confidence when it comes to my ability to work in a team. It reveals that I work better in a group than on my own. Good observation, communication skills, organisation and my strong intuition about people means I have the potential of being not just a good team player but also a team leader. Using these skills, I can organise and assist each member in taking advantage of their unique characteristics and traits, making me a great mediator if problems arise. I appreciate different perspectives and views and thrives on putting unique ideas into action.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">When forming a team, it is ideal for anyone to find like-minded people with similar goals to work together. However, I believe I can work with anyone, even people with different personality traits and different goals to an extent; as long as I get to know the individual, there is a different way to work with anyone. As an employer myself, although I have not been recruiting based on personality tests, these tests can reflect a lot on the suitability of the individual to the particular role they are applying for. And for both group projects, asking for these tests results would be useful and will definitely be taken into account when forming a team.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Overview - In this project, our main focus leads to be that we would render the aspect of game development. Therefore, we will also detect that why game development (using these software’s and applications) are interesting especially in this approach. It shows the actual reason for which they could simply lead in to the aspect of generating better games through the usability of these platforms. In addition to this, in this manifestation; we would completely lead to describing an in-depth investigation and a real time analysis about this project of game development. We will also encompass the necessary and fundamental skills for the game development and the outcome of this project, such that it could be successful.</span>

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Motivation – As per my understanding and observation, this project of game development leads to be useful for multiple reasons. The games turn up to be our source of entertainment. Therefore, the games play a vital role in our everyday life and almost every one of us plays games of various types, nature and intensity. As per the recent statistics, there are almost 2.7 billion game players over the 7 billion population worldwide.&nbsp;(STATISTA, JANUARY 26, 2021) So, in this possible way, the game development is very useful and has captured one of the biggest markets all across the world.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Description &nbsp;– The major tools used in the game development include Unity, Construct two or Cocos2d. These game development service tools actually possess the features of game development in 2D features. All of them provide almost the same interface. But the games lead to be two dimensional of all of these game programming interfaces. The technologies used in these game development programming interfaces; actually include the aspect of rendering a direct and user-friendly interface in which they could simply overlook and develop the characters with the state of these interfaces' art usability.

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As far as the approach of game development is concerned, there are actually many requirements on the basis of which the game development has been carried up. It necessarily and fundamentally acquires some of the software and hardware requirements as per which they could simply be capable enough to devise and initiate the games of their consideration. The hardware and the software requirements for the game development include the following aspect, it is enlisted and taken forth as; (Wu, 17 NOV 2012)</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Hardware requirements: For the game development, it is necessary for the developer to have a personal computer (PC) with a central processing unit (CPU) of at least 3GhZ with having the Random access memory (RAM) of 8GB and a better graphic card to gain better graphical performance while developing the game. It is actually the hardware requirement for the hardware development in the aspect of game development.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Software requirement: The major requirements in the software should only be that it should be capable enough to include such features that provide ample ease of use and utility in which they could use to develop state of the art games with strong capability of use.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">For the game development, it actually varies which type of software the game developer likes or which he considers to be useful for them. In the technological era of today. There is not any specific or a single type of software that serves to be as the game development programming interface. Therefore, these programming interfaces are actually infinite in the market and are not particular from the ones that could be selected and used for the game development. These game development tools actually differ in its ease of use, features, efficiency, game development interface and various capabilities. Amongst the infinite game development software’s, the major and the most common of them actually include the Unity, Construct2, Cocos2d, Go Dot, G Develop, Unreal studio, Game maker studio, Click team fusion 2.5.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In addition to this, the free open-source software’s which are used as the game development programming interfaces include the following aspects e.g. the Go Dot gaming development programming interface, Cocos2d, Mono Game, Starling, Delta gaming engine, superpowers gaming development interface and G Develop game development interface. These are actually the examples of free open source gaming development software.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Furthermore, these are the equipment’s which are actually necessarily used.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <br>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Skills Required – The skills which necessary for this game development include good programming skills, game development skills and skill to actually develop the game e.g., that is actually a mixture of programming and artistic skills. As it has been already initiated that there are many options when it comes to the aspect and perspective of game development software’s. Games could be written and devised on many of them. But, amongst them, the best software is the Go Dot Gaming Development interface. It is feasible to find the required hardware and software depending on the ones needed and usability to pertain and follow up the game development.</span>
          </p>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <br>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Outcome – In case if the project leads to be successful and emerges to have better results in this context, then it is possible that the game which has been developed in these software’s may capture the market. We also suggest the actual hardware requirements, software requirements and equipment’s which are fundamental for the manifestation of game development. If this project is successful, then the main advantage that would likely be gained is an acquisition to develop an efficient and effective game. This development's main impact will have might lead to developing a game.</span>
